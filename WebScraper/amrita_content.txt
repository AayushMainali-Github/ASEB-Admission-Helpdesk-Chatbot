Students Testimonials
Data is based on on-campus information
Student
Amrita University is a place where one can learn, make the fullest of their time and enjoy many such life preaching activities. During my stay at Amrita University for a total of three years, I came across a variety of people from different countries and cultures. I had received so many opportunities to express the best version of myself, a big thank you to my ever-inspiring mentors who helped me discover the part of myself that I could present to the world. Amrita is a temple of knowledge and values whereby we can find two types of gurus- Shiksha Guru and Diksha Guru.

World Water Day 2025
Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has nurtured water-sustainable communities across India, empowering them to become water-wise.
Through community-driven initiatives like
Jivamritam
, it has provided purified drinking water to
300+ communities
, ensuring long-term water security.
Amrita’s initiatives are powered by strategic collaborations with national and international partners across academia, government, and industry.
Water is the essence of life, yet the world stands on the brink of a severe water crisis. Estimates suggest that, by 2050, three out of four people could face the devastating impacts of drought, while the economic toll of water scarcity already surpasses $307 billion annually (UNU-INWEH, 2024). Today, approximately 720 million people—10% of the global population—are struggling with high to critical water stress (UN Water, 2024).
These figures throw light on the fact that the precious resource often referred to as Blue Gold, will become inaccessible to future generations if the crisis on hand is not resolved with utmost care. The solution is not centred around having too little water, but empowering communities across the globe to manage the scenarios concerning dynamic changes in the environment.
Due to a lack of sufficient knowledge and skills, countless people are suffering at the expense of becoming water refugees. With an ever-increasing disparity across the globe and countries being divided into water-rich and water-poor nations, wars over water could become a reality.
Founded under the visionary leadership of Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is deeply committed to helping prevent such a tragedy through projects that strengthen water sustainability. Amrita acts upon its commitment to leverage technologies for the benefit of humanity by launching various practical initiatives and conducting interdisciplinary research in water and sanitation.
Approximately 63 million people in rural India do not have access to clean drinking water. For many villagers in India, especially women and young girls, collecting and carrying water is a torturous way of life, almost a health hazard. They have to walk several kilometres, sometimes multiple times a day, to collect and transport water to fulfil daily duties like cooking, washing, cleaning, and caring for cattle.
To address this challenge and reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases in rural communities, faculty, staff, and students of Amrita conceptualized and designed the Jivamritam Filtration System. It has been deployed in 300 villages across India, and each system is structured to serve a community of 300-400 families.
The supply and sustenance of this improved access to safe drinking water is ensured through a community-driven participatory model. The Jivamritam project was inaugurated by the then President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, on October 8th, 2017, in Kerala, India.
In 2022, to make water sustainability a reality in rural India, Amrita launched the “My Village, Our Water” initiative in collaboration with ESRI India. This program uses geospatial technologies to shift societal perceptions from “MY water” to “OUR water.” Currently implemented across 150 villages in 14 Indian states, the initiative empowers communities to map and monitor water resources, quality, and climate impacts; identify sustainability challenges using extensive crowd-sourced data; and support local administrations in optimizing water usage, conserving resources, and building awareness.
As well, to help directly reach people, Amrita created the Empower Community App to provide online training and coordinate development activities. The data is visualized using ESRI’s ArcGIS Online platform, offering interactive maps and dashboards for better decision-making.
In 2018, in response to the massive floods in Kerala, Amrita has implemented a project to empower women as sustainability officers in rural communities (the “WISE project” – Women In Sustaining the Environment). Training women as Water Ambassadors (WAs) in India and Africa, it equips them with low-cost, reliable water testing kits to monitor household drinking water quality. In Kerala, Karnataka, and Tanzania, 26 Water Ambassadors are actively monitoring 1,500 households each month, ensuring safe water for families.
Meanwhile, Amrita’s seaweed cultivation initiative has empowered 64 women with training in sustainable seaweed farming, equipping them with essential skills and tools. Since 2024, over 10,000 kg of seaweed have been harvested from two farms in Olaikuda and Thirupalikudi villages in Ramanathapuram, generating a total income of ₹193,960 for participants.
Additionally, 30 women received certifications from the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), enhancing their credentials and employability. The program also introduced training in value-added product development, such as seaweed-based soaps and pickles, enabling women to diversify their income sources.
Another innovation is work by
Amrita’s Sanitation Biotechnology Lab
on different aspects of sanitation issues involved with faecal contaminants in wastewater. The initiative is in collaboration with research institutes across the world, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
It deploys different microbiological and ecological control strategies to reduce the load of biogenic smells and pathogens and make the wastewater suitable for reuse and valorization. The University also focuses on tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a major global concern, by developing bacteriophage-based monitoring and mitigation systems.
Internationally, Amrita has established strategic partnerships to advance research and innovation in water sustainability. Collaborating with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Netherlands, it has launched the
International Joint Centre for Excellence in Water Sustainability
, emphasizing water system advancements and technology adoption.
Additionally, a partnership with Durham University, UK, supported by the British Council focuses on water and energy sustainability, further reinforcing Amrita’s commitment to achieving the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.
As the world grapples with an escalating water crisis, Amrita remains steadfast in its mission to pioneer solutions that ensure clean water access, empower communities, and drive impactful change. Through research, innovation, and collaboration, the University’s initiatives continue to shape a water-secure future for generations to come.

World Water Day 2025
Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has nurtured water-sustainable communities across India, empowering them to become water-wise.
Through community-driven initiatives like
Jivamritam
, it has provided purified drinking water to
300+ communities
, ensuring long-term water security.
Amrita’s initiatives are powered by strategic collaborations with national and international partners across academia, government, and industry.
Water is the essence of life, yet the world stands on the brink of a severe water crisis. Estimates suggest that, by 2050, three out of four people could face the devastating impacts of drought, while the economic toll of water scarcity already surpasses $307 billion annually (UNU-INWEH, 2024). Today, approximately 720 million people—10% of the global population—are struggling with high to critical water stress (UN Water, 2024).
These figures throw light on the fact that the precious resource often referred to as Blue Gold, will become inaccessible to future generations if the crisis on hand is not resolved with utmost care. The solution is not centred around having too little water, but empowering communities across the globe to manage the scenarios concerning dynamic changes in the environment.
Due to a lack of sufficient knowledge and skills, countless people are suffering at the expense of becoming water refugees. With an ever-increasing disparity across the globe and countries being divided into water-rich and water-poor nations, wars over water could become a reality.
Founded under the visionary leadership of Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is deeply committed to helping prevent such a tragedy through projects that strengthen water sustainability. Amrita acts upon its commitment to leverage technologies for the benefit of humanity by launching various practical initiatives and conducting interdisciplinary research in water and sanitation.
Approximately 63 million people in rural India do not have access to clean drinking water. For many villagers in India, especially women and young girls, collecting and carrying water is a torturous way of life, almost a health hazard. They have to walk several kilometres, sometimes multiple times a day, to collect and transport water to fulfil daily duties like cooking, washing, cleaning, and caring for cattle.
To address this challenge and reduce the prevalence of waterborne diseases in rural communities, faculty, staff, and students of Amrita conceptualized and designed the Jivamritam Filtration System. It has been deployed in 300 villages across India, and each system is structured to serve a community of 300-400 families.
The supply and sustenance of this improved access to safe drinking water is ensured through a community-driven participatory model. The Jivamritam project was inaugurated by the then President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, on October 8th, 2017, in Kerala, India.
In 2022, to make water sustainability a reality in rural India, Amrita launched the “My Village, Our Water” initiative in collaboration with ESRI India. This program uses geospatial technologies to shift societal perceptions from “MY water” to “OUR water.” Currently implemented across 150 villages in 14 Indian states, the initiative empowers communities to map and monitor water resources, quality, and climate impacts; identify sustainability challenges using extensive crowd-sourced data; and support local administrations in optimizing water usage, conserving resources, and building awareness.

Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has won the prestigious
Times Higher Education (THE) Asia Award
for its Outstanding Contribution to Environmental Leadership. At the heart of this recognition is the groundbreaking initiative,
Live-in-Labs
®, our internship program in rural India. The students live in impoverished villages across the country to collaborate with the community and find sustainable solutions for the challenges the people face in their daily lives.
“Science and technology are rapidly advancing, but how can those improvements reach the world’s poorest and create a sustainable future for all?” said THE in bestowing the award.
“That was the question that spurred senior leaders at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham to launch Amrita Live-in-Labs ® —an initiative that takes students and staff outside their campus classrooms and laboratories and into rural communities in India.”
Live-in-Labs® is based on a vision Amma shared with the
United Nations Academic Impact Conference on Technology for Sustainable Development
held in New York in 2015. As Chancellor of Amrita, she said universities should take into consideration how much society has been able to use their research to serve the lowest and most vulnerable strata of society.
“All universities should send their students for internships in impoverished rural villages or city slums. They would be able to directly witness the problems that the poor face and listen to what the people have to say. They could then write papers about it. This would help awaken compassion in their young minds,” said Amma in her keynote address.
Since Amma began Live-in-Labs® in 2013, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has reached more than 1 million beneficiaries across 25 states. Students with more than 30 institutions from around the world have travelled to India to join in. Overall, students and faculty have clocked in a monumental 400,000+ hours in the field working towards sustainable development in rural communities.
“Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is extremely honoured to be selected for our contribution to Environmental Leadership by THE Awards Asia 2024. When Amma envisioned Live-in-Labs® over a decade ago, Amrita was one of the first universities in the world to provide an opportunity for students to experience village life and codesign sustainable solutions for solving the challenges in the community,” said Dr Maneesha V Ramesh, Amrita’s Provost & Dean of
Amrita School for Sustainable Futures
.
“The program was devised to instill compassion in the youth and empower communities through their involvement. Thereby, providing an ecosystem to translate scientific advances to uplift the villagers at the bottom of the pyramid and create a sustainable future for all. Our impact is a testament to our work, and it is a proud moment to be awarded by THE. There is more to do and we shall remain steadfast in our mission to offer sustainable solutions.”
To name just three of Live-in-Labs® successful projects, THE cited the ricycle, a low-cost rice planting machine; a load-carrying aid for women; and compressed earth block technology for houses. They are concrete examples of how Amrita University is leading practical solutions to empower rural people, alongside alignment with the needs of our planet.
Amrita was also the only Indian institution to receive an award this year. Judges said its “innovative efforts mobilise much of the brain power of the university in service of environmental sustainability while helping students to develop essential competencies to become sustainability stewards: empathy, humility, compassion”.
Valuably, they continued, the program also highlighted “the power of collaboration among people from different walks of life in addressing shared challenges”.
This esteemed recognition by THE celebrates innovation throughout Asia’s higher education institutions. Eighty finalists were in the running across 10 categories, and overall, there were 600 entries with 17 countries and territories from across the region.
Previously, THE has also rated Amrita among the world’s top universities in its Impact Rankings. They are the only global indicators to rate universities’ progress towards the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In its 2023 assessment, THE rated Amrita 1st in India and 52nd in the world, and the work of Live-in-Labs® is one of the key components for this recognition. The rankings include 1,406 universities from 106 countries and regions.
For the 2024 Asia Awards overall, Phil Baty, THE’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, noted the “wealth” of innovation across the region.
“We received such a flood of excellent entries that I have to emphasise that these 10 winners—chosen through a rigorous and robust judging process—are but the primus inter pares, the first among a host of quality submissions that our experts singled out,” he said.

Civil engineers are responsible for conceiving, designing, constructing, supervising, operating, major infrastructural projects. The work can span over various areas including roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, bridges, dams, etc.
In a Q&A session with
Dr Mini K M, Chairperson: Civil Engineering, Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore Campus,
we bring all you need know about this high-in-demand discipline of engineering.

There is no doubt in saying that technological advancements are witnessing rapid transformation but as faculty it is our prime responsibility to ensure that they would be up to date. Our curriculum is framed after thorough consultations with expert academicians and industry, who are in our Board of Academic Studies. The topics are cherry-picked based on the current and future trends. For instance, currently we are going the computational way but the curriculum changes once three to four years.
We in fact, have an MOU with L&T and one of their experts is part of our Board of Academic Studies. The latest trend is about 3D printers, we have introduced 3D printing construction methods. One batch of final year students are into learning this technology.
Another hot subject is Artificial Intelligence which deals with replacing manual labour with machines, robotics. The students after 4 years of study step out, well equipped with all that is trending in this area.

Civil engineering is a very interesting subject. It is one branch of engineering, where we can design, visualize and analyse the results there and then. When it comes to safety measures, we can enjoy while working and at the same time it is equally important to ensure certain precautionary measures. I often receive videos from our former students, with details of the prestigious projects completed by them. They thank all the faculty profusely and it gives us immense satisfaction.

Besides intense academic learning, the students also get introduced to regular industry visits, internships, interactions with the experts from industry and academia to boost their confidence levels. E-Learning is another interesting concept, in which students get to watch and study presentations, videos, research reports. This gives students a fair idea on what to expect in the industry, after joining jobs. We also encourage students to go for online courses being offered by public premier institutes and do certifications. Through these students get exposed both to conventional learning and even latest topics – all at the same time.
In fact, we don’t encourage the concept of spoon feeding. We believe attending online courses will enhance the self-learning capacity of the students. While taking these courses, they receive enough guidance from the faculty and also get separate credit assigned to it.

The students would complete all their core courses by the end of 3
rd
year. At that juncture, many students would express interest in certain specialisations, and we would guide them according to that. If the student wants to go for higher studies, we guide them on picking up the right electives. Around 99% per cent students get through campus selections.
In such cases, many students will be sent by the corporate companies for higher studies while few quite their jobs and get back to us asking for guidance. The current trend is such that, a majority of students are going for higher studies. For those students wanting to study in India, we aid students in writing GATE for admission into public sector premier institutes or if they wish to move abroad, help will be rendered in successfully appearing for GRE, TOEFEL. Constant interactions are also arranged on regular basis with those who cracked civil services, other government exams as job opportunities for civil engineers are aplenty in the public sector.

From the department, we teach, guide students on how to obtain high scores in these examinations. At Amrita, we also have Corporate & Industry Relations, a unique and dedicated setup which offers coaching to crack GATE, GRE exams with the help of faculty. Civil engineering is growing hub of opportunities and students need not always go for a job. They can start on their own, generate jobs and contribute back to the society.

Civil engineering is a vast area with countless number of opportunities. The students after completing their course will attain an idea on where they would fit in. Few students may be interested in structural engineering, geo-technical, water resources, transportation etc. Based on their interest, we help them in career.

As far as internship is concerned, many of our alumni are entrepreneurs and are always on the forefront to help their juniors. Those who are already placed with corporates too aid our students in getting internship opportunities through their HR. We have several stakeholders and they offer phenomenal help. The CIR too also helps in getting placement and internships.
How advanced are infrastructure and lab facilities in the Civil Engineering Departments?
All of our labs are sophisticated and fully equipped. Besides that the department also houses research labs like High Strength Concrete Lab, Energy Efficient Materials Lab, Advanced Water Treatment Processing Lab. We encourage students to be active in these research labs along with the faculty and publish papers in highly rated journals. This will give added advantage to the students for further studies like MS. We also have a separate library for our department.

Overview
The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) is a six-year specialised program that prepares students for an impactful career in the healthcare industry. Unlike traditional pharmacy degrees, Pharm D emphasises clinical practice, students here are trained at the university’s teaching hospital, Amrita Hospital Kochi, where they are exposed to real-world medical scenarios. This hands-on experience enhances their knowledge and understanding, providing them with a unique edge that sets them apart in many aspects.
The program combines in-depth classroom instructions with extensive clinical exposure, ensuring that students gain a comprehensive understanding of pharmacology, patient counselling, and evidence-based medication management. With a growing demand for skilled healthcare professionals worldwide, Pharm D graduates are uniquely positioned to lead in hospital settings, community pharmacies, research, etc.
The curriculum includes subjects such as pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, clinical pharmacy,
pharmacotherapeutics
, and pharmacy practice, equipping students with expertise in drug therapy management, disease prevention, and patient care. Students gain hands-on experience through clinical rotations in hospitals, where they learn to manage patient medication therapies, collaborate with healthcare teams, and provide drug information to patients and professionals. The course also emphasises clinical research, pharmacovigilance, and public health, preparing graduates to make significant contributions to patient safety and healthcare outcomes.
Graduates, upon completion of the course, can pursue a Master of Pharmacy (
M.Pharm
) degree, a Ph.D. in any specialised field, or even an MBA in healthcare management. Pharm D graduates have a wide range of job opportunities in various sectors of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.
At Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, you’ll benefit from the top-tier facilities, experienced faculties, and industry partnerships. If you are ready to shape the future healthcare industry through your expertise, join Amrita’s Pharm-D program today!

Bachelor of Optometry program is a four-year degree program including one-year compulsory internship that deals with the examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science.
One can also define it as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) which is imbued with the idea of improving the vision of the human eye and remove obstacles of sight which an individual may experience. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to help people, achieve personal growth, and earn community respect, with financial success thus offering unlimited opportunities.

The program is envisaged to develop multipurpose ophthalmic manpower at allied health level. The training will enable a student to become competent in providing service as an Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant to the community in urban, semi-urban, rural setting excluding private, semi-Governmental and Governmental sectors. In the past decade, a fundamental shift has occurred in healthcare delivery, largely due to advances in science and technology. There is a huge dearth of trained ophthalmic manpower using advance technology in vision care science.
Scope and Career Options are:
Assist ophthalmologists in hospital clinic
Practice in optical establishments

The program places a strong emphasis on research, enabling students to develop critical thinking skills, analytical abilities, and research competencies. Through coursework and hands-on research projects, students learn to conduct empirical studies, analyze data, and contribute to the evidence base of social work practice.

The Honours Research track provides students with the opportunity to undertake advanced coursework and independent research under the guidance of faculty mentors. This allows students to pursue their academic interests in depth and produce a high-quality research thesis on a topic of their choice.

Students have the opportunity to gain practical experience through field placements in social welfare agencies, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and community-based organizations. These placements provide students with hands-on experience working with diverse populations and addressing real-world social issues.

The program adopts an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, economics, political science, technology and other relevant disciplines. This interdisciplinary perspective equips students with a comprehensive understanding of the complex social dynamics and systemic factors that shape individuals’ lives and communities.

Ethical considerations are integral to the curriculum, with an emphasis on promoting social justice, human rights, and cultural competence. Students learn to navigate ethical dilemmas, uphold professional standards, and advocate for the rights and dignity of marginalized and vulnerable populations.

Graduates of the program are well-equipped to pursue diverse career opportunities in social work practice, research, policy analysis, advocacy, community development, and social
welfare
administration. They may find employment in a wide range of settings including social service agencies, NGOs, government departments, healthcare facilities, schools, and international organizations.

Students receive exposure from full-time, qualified, and experienced faculty members, including international instructors, which prepares them to secure placements nationally and abroad. The global relationships and first-rate facilities and infrastructure further enhance this. There is a strong emphasis on engaging students in research projects to get students ready to submit their own excellent research papers to peer-reviewed international journals. Students gain exposure to international events such as C20 as well as workshops and seminars led by nationally and internationally renowned professionals serving as visiting faculty.

95% of students enrolled in Amritapuri Campus are residential students. First-year students are accommodated in hostels located in the ashram premises. Facilities available include large and spacious dining halls, cafes selling wholesome Indian and Western goodies, a juice stall, a provisions’ store, and a western stationary shop.
Wheneven Amma is in the ashram, students have the opportunity to meet Amma and take her blessings. Living in the hostels on campus is akin to having a home away from home, for majority of our students

A Day in the Life of a Student
The day for a residential student begins with worship at Kalari, a temple inside the Ashram. Breakfast is served at 07:00 a.m. Classes begin by 08:30 a.m. Slot time-table is followed by all batches on campus. As per this, class hours for student are 08:30 a.m. to 04:30 p.m.
In accordance with the continuous evaluation system followed by our institution, students are assessed and evaluated throughout the semester. On a given day, it is very likely that students may have project work or quizzes and assignments in several classes. Amrita has a credit-based course curriculum, and assignments, seminars, presentations, practicals, and viva voce are part of daily life on the campus. This system helps inculcate a sense of responsibility among students. It helps them become creative and productive during their study period; this, in turn, helps them when they join a company after completing their studies.
A certain percentage of attendance is mandatory in order to write the examinations in all courses. Lunch break is from 12:00 noon to 01:50 p.m. Students stay back on campus after regular class hours with prior permission. This is required for those who want to use the additional time to complete their laboratory or written assignments. In the evening, students have the opportunity to attend evening bhajans in the Ashram prayer hall. In Amma’s divine presence, they become relaxed after intense college hours. After bhajans, dinner is served till 09:00 p.m.

Yoga and Meditation
IAM Technique is a powerful meditation technique synthesized by Amma to help people find fulfillment in life. When practiced regularly, the technique refines one’s mind — bringing relaxation, concentration, a more expansive sense of self and greater awareness. Ultimately the technique takes practitioners to the goal of human life – realization of the divinity pervading all of creation. Amma’s senior disciples teach the technique free of charge in all parts of the world.
IAM TechniqueÂ® is taught not only to Amma’s devotees, but also to organizations throughout the world, including corporations, educational institutions and correctional facilities. MAM undertook the massive project of teaching IAM TechniqueÂ® to India’s 13 lakh [1.3 million] paramilitary personnel. Classes were taught to the Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Sahsra Seema Bal, Central Reserve Police Force and Indo-Tibetan Border Police. Pilot classes were also taught to soldiers of the Indian Army and Navy. Training in IAM TechniqueÂ® is given to all students on campus. Frequent refresher classes are also conducted.

This is a peer reviewed conference and hence paper submissions cannot be accepted over email. You must submit your full paper using the paper submission link at:
https://www.amrita.edu/events/gender-technology-conference-2025#call-for-papers

While we’re aiming for our conference to be primarily in-person, we can make exceptions to allow for virtual presentations of selected accepted papers.
Please submit your paper and we will be able to discuss your individual case with our technical program committee regarding participating virtually.

At this time, the conference is an in-person conference. Travel funding can be considered on a case by case basis for select researchers with accepted papers. However, general travel funding for attendees is not currently available.

We recommend using an A1 size for the posters. The A1 format, with dimensions of 594 mm x 841 mm (23.4 inches x 33.1 inches), offers ample space to effectively communicate our research while adhering to commonly accepted conference standards.
In addition to choosing the right size, you might find the design tips below worthwhile, as they could potentially enhance the poster’s impact:
Text Readability:
Ensure the text is readable from about 2 meters away by using a minimum font size of 18 points, with 20 or 24 points being ideal. Opt for clear fonts such as Arial (sans-serif) or Georgia (serif) to maintain legibility.
Visuals and Data Presentation:
Utilize charts and graphs to present data in an easy way. High-quality images such photos or diagrams should have a resolution of at least 150 pixels per inch to ensure clarity when printed. Label data directly on the graphs whenever possible, and include descriptive titles for each visual element to guide the viewer.
Balanced Layout:
Make sure to leave sufficient space between different elements—text, graphs, and images—to avoid a cluttered appearance. A balanced layout will make the poster more inviting and easier to read.

Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) Circuit Design is the process of designing a large computer chip (more specifically, an integrated circuit, or IC), using computer-aided design (CAD) tools on a workstation or a personal computer (PC). The course demands learning the principles of VLSI design, designing and fabricating state of-the-art VLSI chips, understanding the complete design flow and expertise to design CMOS chips for industrial requirements. The curriculum focuses on employing hierarchical design methods and understanding the design issues at the various levels of hierarchy. Students are exposed to various design softwares in this programme. Also, they learn to design, simulate, implement and test complex digital systems using FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). The main objectives of this course are to analyze the electrical and design characteristics of transistors and gates and to study the issues and methodologies involved in the integration of these devices into complex high-performance systems.
With the recent and rapid upsurge in the areas like hardware software co-design, architectures for machine intelligence, network on chip etc. the programme is designed to cater to the needs in producing engineers trained in both hardware and software areas, bridging the gap between academia and industry. Students will be trained in several topics that cut across different domains, starting from the lowermost level of physical devices to the top level of application development.

PO1
Anability to independently carry out research/investigation and development work to solve practical problems.
PO2
Anability to write and present a substantial technical report/document.
PO3

Smart Climate Monitoring for Large Scale Buildings
Company
: Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited, Coimbatore
Abstract
Air conditioning systems in large scale buildings contribute a major portion of the energy requirements. A centralized temperature monitoring system would result in the enhancement of air conditioning services in large scale buildings. Here we develop a centralized temperature monitoring scheme suitable for office environments. Wireless sensors are placed inside a compartmentalized office area, which collects the surrounding temperature data and sends it to the cloud. The application in the cloud will receive this data, store the data and present this data graphically to the end user. In order to reduce the redundant data as well as for making the sensor network energy efficient, we carry out a data analytics algorithm to identify the redundant sensors in the network based on data correlation.
Hybrid Localization Algorithm for Indoor Asset Tracking
Abstract
Main focus of this research work is to design an efficient and scalable RFID based hybrid indoor localization algorithm that operates over long-range RFID readers. The major objectives of this work are to design an approach that is extensible to large environments with minimal calibration and to provide high accuracy. Asset tracking is important for resource utilization and recovery. It is a service that helps locate objects instantly by providing easy access of item locations without much manual effort. We design a hybrid localization algorithm to accurately estimate the position of an object within a finite indoor space. Our approach uses power level and signal strength parameters which are readily available without the requirement of additional hardware. Furthermore, our algorithm applies intelligent region elimination techniques, thereby avoiding the use of heavy calibration and computationally complex algorithms.
Securing Image Posts in Social Networking
Abstract
The most unbeatable technology, Internet brings to people for communication is social networks. With the exponential growth of users in internet, there is an equivalent growth among internet users to regularly visit social websites for linking with their friends, sharing thoughts, photos, videos and even discuss about their day today activities. The fact these social networks are available to all the users for free, leads to various types of security issues. Image security has been a topic of research over decades. Enhancements to individual techniques and combinations proposed till date have offered different levels of security assurances. This work aim to present a technique for secure sharing of image posts in social network. The significant feature of the scheme lies in the selection of security technique based on image content, evaluation of peers with whom the image can be shared based on text classification, transliteration and tone analysis. The proposed scheme a cost effective solution as it does not require any additional hardware. The utility of the model is demonstrated by mapping the scheme with Facebook and analyzing its performance through simulation.

Chennai
Chennai is the cultural capital of South India. This 350 years old city has the vibe of young hearts. British had a stronghold on Madras during the independence era and did many good deeds to the city. They were the prime reason for the drastic development of Chennai city, which was once just a forest land.
The northern part of Chennai is primarily an industrial area, and the central part is the commercial heart of the city. Whereas South and west Chennai are mostly residential areas. Kodambakkam is the cinema hub of Kollywood, filled with lots of film industries, studios and cinema sets. Irrespective of the metropolis heart Chennai perfectly balances its old heritage and the modern vibe. It’s a sight to behold the Chennai’s skyline which is brimming with skyscrapers. Once you are in Chennai you will quickly adapt to its hustle bustle and will tend to love its multiface.

Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Mysuru Campus celebrated its 14th Graduation Day, marking a significant milestone for graduating students. The event honored the academic achievements of the graduates in a grand ceremony graced by distinguished dignitaries.
Learning doesn’t end after graduation. Many changes are happening in the corporate sector. Students should understand this changing scenario and learn and unlearn accordingly, opined Shri. Karthi Baskar, Managing Director and CEO, FFAF Logistics India Pvt. Ltd. He advised students to keep updating their knowledge to stay relevant in the workforce.
He was addressing the fresh graduates at 14th Graduation Day of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mysuru Campus on October 6th, 2024. He further highlighted the growing importance of technology in the professional world. Incorporating a “technology mindset” is crucial to succeeding in today’s industries. The industry expects students to learn the necessary skills, and technology plays a significant role in that. You must adopt this mindset while learning, Baskar stated, encouraging graduates to be proactive in gaining tech-related skills that will enhance their career prospects.
Beyond professional development, Baskar also reminded the students of their social responsibilities. He urged them to contribute to society, at least in their leisure time, highlighting the importance of giving back to the community.
Guest of Honour,
Dr. Sasangan Ramanathan
, Dean Academics and Member of the Vice Chancellor’s Advisory Board, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, encouraged graduates to “do something nice for others” every year on this special day, reinforcing the importance of kindness and community spirit. Dr. Ramanathan stressed that while higher degrees are essential in today’s rapidly changing world, possessing the right skill set is equally crucial for career success.
He advised students to “listen more and talk less,” highlighting that positivity is key to personal and professional growth. He urged graduates to be respectful of others in their interactions, fostering an atmosphere of mutual understanding and kindness.
In his benedictory address, Sampujya Swami Poornamritananda Puri, General Secretary of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, shared profound insights with the graduates, encouraging them to approach life with humility and a desire for continuous learning.

Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Mysuru Campus celebrated its 14th Graduation Day, marking a significant milestone for graduating students. The event honored the academic achievements of the graduates in a grand ceremony graced by distinguished dignitaries.
Learning doesn’t end after graduation. Many changes are happening in the corporate sector. Students should understand this changing scenario and learn and unlearn accordingly, opined Shri. Karthi Baskar, Managing Director and CEO, FFAF Logistics India Pvt. Ltd. He advised students to keep updating their knowledge to stay relevant in the workforce.
He was addressing the fresh graduates at 14th Graduation Day of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mysuru Campus on October 6th, 2024. He further highlighted the growing importance of technology in the professional world. Incorporating a “technology mindset” is crucial to succeeding in today’s industries. The industry expects students to learn the necessary skills, and technology plays a significant role in that. You must adopt this mindset while learning, Baskar stated, encouraging graduates to be proactive in gaining tech-related skills that will enhance their career prospects.
Beyond professional development, Baskar also reminded the students of their social responsibilities. He urged them to contribute to society, at least in their leisure time, highlighting the importance of giving back to the community.
Guest of Honour,
Dr. Sasangan Ramanathan
, Dean Academics and Member of the Vice Chancellor’s Advisory Board, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, encouraged graduates to “do something nice for others” every year on this special day, reinforcing the importance of kindness and community spirit. Dr. Ramanathan stressed that while higher degrees are essential in today’s rapidly changing world, possessing the right skill set is equally crucial for career success.
He advised students to “listen more and talk less,” highlighting that positivity is key to personal and professional growth. He urged graduates to be respectful of others in their interactions, fostering an atmosphere of mutual understanding and kindness.
In his benedictory address, Sampujya Swami Poornamritananda Puri, General Secretary of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, shared profound insights with the graduates, encouraging them to approach life with humility and a desire for continuous learning.
Swamiji reminded the audience that “our knowledge is limited” and that the key to expanding it lies in being humble. He emphasized that personality holds greater importance than mere intelligence, urging students to cultivate qualities of character alongside their intellectual pursuits.

The technology in our world is advancing in ways that are unimaginable—until they happen. For example, what used to be a “phone” is now a personal assistant powered by AI. And according to the UN, 5.5 billion of our world’s 8.2 billion people came online as of 2024. But what does this mean for our world’s women and girls?
When it comes to tech industries, not surprisingly, there is still a huge gap between women and men. The globally-renowned WomenTech Network states that at the current rate, it will take more than 130 years to close the economic gender gap.
But just as technology is evolving exponentially, the speed at which we can reach gender parity can expand too. With this vision, Amrita University held the
International Conference on Gender and Technology
(ICGT) from January 16 to 19. Five hundred global stakeholders came together to break today’s trends and reach those who are most likely to be left behind.
In her honorary address Amma said, “Just like the two wings of a bird, men and women have an equal role to play in society. Only when this truth is accepted will society become harmonious.”
Amma emphasised the societal harm when women are not empowered, citing the loss of both direct contributions and care for others. She called upon women to embrace their unique qualities to transform the world.
Dr Bhavani Rao R
is Amrita’s
UNESCO Chair on Gender Equality & Women’s Empowerment
and Dean of the
School of Social & Behavioural Sciences
. Carrying forward Amma’s words, she stated, “Why now? It’s 2025, it’s time that we do something significant about gender equality.”
She further explained, “We have sparked vital conversations on the intersection of gender and tech, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. The impact goes beyond dialogue, inspiring change, fostering action, and building a community committed to creating a more inclusive and equitable tech future.”
ICGT took place in collaboration with UNESCO and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). As the world’s largest technical professional society, it is dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity.
Although new terrain in our shifting world, ICGT had a compelling impact. More than 60 keynote speakers, panelists, and session chairs took part. They included government representatives, experts, policymakers, civil society, industry leaders, gender financing institutions, and a wide range of researchers and students.
Among those who took part was Dr Manisha Gupta, Staff Research Scientist at Google. In her keynote address, she questioned whether AI is truly for all genders in its present state. Through real-world examples, she concluded how AI-driven solutions can empower gender-diverse communities and create a more equitable technological world.
“This was the best conference I’ve ever been to in my life, and even now, almost daily, I find myself revisiting moments that fill my heart with gratitude,” shared Dr Gupta.
“Hearing perspectives from some of the most accomplished technologists and social scientists in the world and experiencing all of this in a deeply spiritual environment, surrounded by real women whose lives have been transformed by Amma’s initiatives—this reminds me why this work matters so much.”
Given the scarcity of research at the intersection of gender and technology, the conference was proud to accept over 90 research papers and 15 poster presentations, showcasing a clear signal that this event is setting a trend in raising awareness around this crucial topic.
Another milestone was the launch of
UNESCO’s Women4Ethical AI, South Asia Chapter
. Co-chaired by Amrita University, it will promote greater participation of women in AI research, design, and policymaking across the region.
Swami Amritaswauprananda Puri
, Amma’s most Senior Disciple and President of Amrita University, shared his insights in a deeply moving way during the valedictory address. Insisting on using the term “human-made” instead of “manmade”, he expressed that nothing can surpass the ultimate technology created by the universe—the miracle of women conceiving, carrying and giving birth to all of humankind.
“Sorry, I must also confess that I once held an outdated perspective regarding gender neutrality and equity, often leaning more toward supporting men over women. This is the first time I’m confessing it in public.
“However, I have since embraced a far more balanced viewpoint, and this significant shift in my thinking is largely thanks to the power of Amma’s presence as a transformative influence for gender equality,” he shared.
“Given this truth, how can we fail to acknowledge, respect, and value the contributions of women and other genders to modern technology?”
The transformative potential of artificial intelligence in advancing gender equity also took center stage at the
GenAI x Gender Tech Hackathon
. Emerging innovators from around the world developed solutions to address challenges faced by women and marginalised communities.
Out of 550 applicants, 250 participants formed 50 teams to compete. In a strong commitment to maximising social impact, all projects developed during the hackathon have been released as open-source solutions, allowing communities worldwide to implement and build upon them.
“While technology is most often associated with profit-making, this hackathon represents a crucial step forward in leveraging AI for social impact,” said Dr. Rao. “It initiates a deep examination of key societal and systemic issues that perpetuate inequalities and challenges us to tailor technology to address these fundamental problems.”
The competition concluded with final presentations evaluated by a distinguished panel, including industry leaders such as Dr. Manisha Gupta from Google, Ms. Jin Ha Kim from the Asian Development Bank, Ms. Beena Sarkar from fractal.ai, Ms. Chinenye Anekwe from UNESCO, and Mr. Mahesh Mohan from the
Amrita Technology Enabling Center
. The top three teams were awarded a total prize pool of ₹100,000.

A Masterpiece of Compassion: Amma’s Focus on Gender Equality Honoured at Cannes

The technology in our world is advancing in ways that are unimaginable—until they happen. For example, what used to be a “phone” is now a personal assistant powered by AI. And according to the UN, 5.5 billion of our world’s 8.2 billion people came online as of 2024. But what does this mean for our world’s women and girls?
When it comes to tech industries, not surprisingly, there is still a huge gap between women and men. The globally-renowned WomenTech Network states that at the current rate, it will take more than 130 years to close the economic gender gap.
But just as technology is evolving exponentially, the speed at which we can reach gender parity can expand too. With this vision, Amrita University held the
International Conference on Gender and Technology
(ICGT) from January 16 to 19. Five hundred global stakeholders came together to break today’s trends and reach those who are most likely to be left behind.
In her honorary address Amma said, “Just like the two wings of a bird, men and women have an equal role to play in society. Only when this truth is accepted will society become harmonious.”
Amma emphasised the societal harm when women are not empowered, citing the loss of both direct contributions and care for others. She called upon women to embrace their unique qualities to transform the world.
Dr Bhavani Rao R
is Amrita’s
UNESCO Chair on Gender Equality & Women’s Empowerment
and Dean of the
School of Social & Behavioural Sciences
. Carrying forward Amma’s words, she stated, “Why now? It’s 2025, it’s time that we do something significant about gender equality.”
She further explained, “We have sparked vital conversations on the intersection of gender and tech, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. The impact goes beyond dialogue, inspiring change, fostering action, and building a community committed to creating a more inclusive and equitable tech future.”
